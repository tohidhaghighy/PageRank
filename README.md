Pagerank with taxation

PageRank is a function that assigns a real number to each page in the Web
(or at least to that portion of the Web that has been crawled and its links
discovered). The intent is that the higher the PageRank of a page, the more
“important” it is. There is not one fixed algorithm for assignment of PageRank,
and in fact variations on the basic idea can alter the relative PageRank of any
two pages

the way to solve the equation v = Mv is by Gaussian elimination
